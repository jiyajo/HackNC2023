# My Pill Tracker

For this project, we utilized React, Node.js, Javascript, HTML, and CSS in order to build an application that helps users track the pills they have to take weekly. Upon logging in, users can view their calendar of medications that they need to take, as well as add more medications if necessary. Users can also set up notifications, so that the application will send the users a text when they need to take their pills.
